    text: `Designed and implemented a Chrome extension using JavaScript, HTML,
     and CSS to enhance clipboard management. This Manifest V3-compliant tool captures user-selected text,
     storing the three most recent snippets via chrome.storage and displaying them in a popup. 
     It effectively leverages Chrome Extension APIs like chrome.tabs, chrome.runtime,
     and chrome.scripting, all while avoiding direct system clipboard interaction for improved security.`,
